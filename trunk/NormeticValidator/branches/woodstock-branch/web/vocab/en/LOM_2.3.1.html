<h1>Vocabulary for the LOM field 2.3.1</h1>
<h2>Kind of contribution.</h2>
<dl>
<dt><code>author</code></dt>
<dd>The author is an entity primarily responsible for making the content of the resource. An author can be a person, institution, group, or other entity. "The person who originates or gives existence to anything" (OED).</dd>
<dt><code>publisher</code></dt>
<dd>The individual or organization responsible for making the resource available in its present form, such as a publishing house, a university department, or a corporate entity. "One who publishes or makes something public" (OED).</dd>
<dt><code>unknown</code></dt>
<dd>Use this term for any named individual or organization whose contribution or role you are unsure of. </dd>
<dt><code>initiator</code></dt>
<dd>The initiator is the person, institution, or funding agency responsible for originally causing the development process. If the initiator is the same entity as the author, simply list once as the author. "One who or that which initiates" (OED).</dd>
<dt><code>terminator</code></dt>
<dd>The terminator is the person or entity responsible for intentionally removing access to the resource. "One who or that which terminates" (OED).</dd>
<dt><code>validator</code></dt>
<dd>The validator is the person or entity responsible for confirming the overall integrity of the resource. "One who or that which confirms the validity of something" (OED).</dd>
<dt><code>editor</code></dt>
<dd>The editor is the person or entity responsible for the revision of the resource for the purposes of publication or public presentation. This role seems closest to the work currently undertaken by those responsible for digitizing and repurposing analog and other resources. Because digitizers and repurposers will be making decisions of an editorial nature (e.g., colour depth, size, sampling rates), and because the LOM provides no specific value for this role, CanCore recommends that they be listed as editors. May compile the work of multiple authors, or enforce common style and usage practices. "One who prepares the literary work of another person or number of persons for publication, by selecting, revising, and arranging the material; also, one who prepares an edition of any literary work; one who cuts and edits a film" (OED).</dd>
<dt><code>graphical designer</code></dt>
<dd>The graphical designer is the specialist or entity responsible for the construction of the visual elements of a resource. Usually works with a team that includes the roles of instructional designer(s), content provider(s), etc.</dd>
<dt><code>technical implementer</code></dt>
<dd>The technical implementer is the specialist or entity using specialized software or equipment in the development of a resource, or for technical support. Usually works with a team that typically includes the roles of instructional designer(s), content provider(s), etc.</dd>
<dt><code>content provider</code></dt>
<dd>The content provider is a person or entity that is secondarily responsible for the content of the resource. This can be an aggregator. It can also be an original creator, the content of whose resource has been used in part in the resource or has been significantly changed in being aggregated, repurposed, or digitized. In the context of an instructional design team, the content provider may be the subject matter expert, qualified to provide information about content used in the development process. </dd>
<dt><code>technical validator</code></dt>
<dd>The technical validator is the person or entity responsible for confirming the technical integrity of the resource.</dd>
<dt><code>educational validator</code></dt>

<dt><code>script writer</code></dt>
<dd>The script writer is the person or entity responsible for the creation of a text read or performed in an audio, video, and/or interactive learning resource. Usually works with a team that includes the roles of instructional designer(s), content provider(s), etc. Use the author value if the script writer is primarily responsible for the content of the resource as a whole.</dd>
<dt><code>instructional designer</code></dt>
<dd>The instructional designer is the specialist or entity responsible for applying research-based principles to the design of instruction. Usually plays a consultative role in a team that typically includes the roles of graphical designer(s), content provider(s), etc.</dd>
