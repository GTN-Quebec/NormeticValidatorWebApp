Some times, when we validate a lom on Firefox 3.0, images and report lines are not displayed.  No exceptions are thrown.  It seems to work fine on other browsers.
Fix bugs mentioned in Claire's document and my answer (TestsLomValidator.doc): c12, c16, c19, c40. 

Optional
========
Remove ApplicationBean1.  It's used only for locale and we could use context.getViewRoot().getLocale() to get it as mentioned in http://www.laliluna.de/javaserver-faces-message-resource-bundle-tutorial.html
Make the following warning and blank lines disappear (in Tomcat's log file): 
Warning: at xsl:stylesheet on line 72 of :
  Running an XSLT 1.0 stylesheet with an XSLT 2.0 processor
After clicking the Check button, disable the button and show an animated image to indicate that the validation is in progress.
Use a center layout?
Display scope of xml file.
Indent XML and colorize it?
Optimize.  Check if it would be possible to allocate less validator and reuse them instead.  Would synchronizing the validate method create an unacceptable bottleneck?  Use profiler maybe.
Make sure that temporary files are purged.
Add Tab for validate from url if I have time?
