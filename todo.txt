Fix bugs mentioned in Claire's document and my answer (TestsLomValidator.doc): c12, c16, c19, c40. 
Write unitary tests and produce report.
Write documentation & report : organization, usage (CLI + GUI), installation, possible improvements, actual limitations & justifications.

Optional
========
Show version number in the footer.
Remove ApplicationBean1.  It's used only for locale and we could use context.getViewRoot().getLocale() to get it as mentioned in http://www.laliluna.de/javaserver-faces-message-resource-bundle-tutorial.html
Make the following warning and blank lines disappear (in Tomcat's log file): 
Warning: at xsl:stylesheet on line 72 of :
  Running an XSLT 1.0 stylesheet with an XSLT 2.0 processor
After clicking the Check button, disable the button and show an animated image to indicate that the validation is in progress.
Use a center layout?
Display scope of xml file.
Display line numbers in xml context.
Optimize.  Check if it would be possible to allocate less validator and reuse them instead.  Would synchronizing the validate method create an unacceptable bottleneck?  Use profiler maybe.
Make sure that temporary files are purged.
Add Tab for validate from url if I have time?
